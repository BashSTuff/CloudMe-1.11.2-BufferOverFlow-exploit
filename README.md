# CloudMe-1.11.2-BufferOverFlow

metasploit module leveraging bof on CloudMe 1.11.12. Slightly modified exploit from Andy Bowden's python PoC: https://www.exploit-db.com/exploits/48389

Feel free to add anywhere. I added to **exploits/windows/misc/**

Feel free to adjust payload. I set a reverse cmd by default for reliability reasons.
